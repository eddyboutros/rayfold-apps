/**
 * Where the bytes live once a command has kept them.
 *
 * An upload is a staging area with a lifetime; a document is not. So a command moves the bytes out of the upload
 * store and into this one, which is a directory of files named by revision id and nothing else. Every document and
 * every revision carries the `url` these are served at, and that is the only way anything else refers to the bytes.
 *
 * Here that is a directory on a volume, which is what a single service with one disk should use. Point `base` at an
 * object store or a CDN and nothing else changes: write the bytes somewhere, keep the URL, serve it. The URL is
 * what crosses a service boundary, so the other services in this fleet never learn where the bytes actually are.

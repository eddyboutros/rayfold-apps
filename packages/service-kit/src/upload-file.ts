/**
 * Uploads written to a directory rather than held in memory or kept in a database row.
 *
 * Lands upstream in @rayfold/server 0.2.1; this repository consumes published packages, so it lives here until then
 * and is deleted when it ships. `UploadStore` is three methods, which is the point of it being an interface.
 *
 * This is the store to reach for when the bytes are files. `MemoryUploadStore` holds everything whole, and
 * `PgUploadStore` puts the bytes in a column — which suits small things and stops suiting them somewhere in the low
 * megabytes, because both ends of a database round trip hold the whole value. Here the bytes are streamed to a file
 * and streamed back out, so what a server needs at once is one chunk, whatever the file weighs.
 *
 *   const uploads = new FileUploadStore({ dir: "/var/lib/app/uploads" });
 *   createHttpHandler(server, { uploads: { store: uploads } });
 *
 * What it is not: permanent storage. An upload is a staging area — bytes arrive, a command names them, and the
 * command takes what it needs and deletes them ([ttlMs] sweeps whatever nobody claimed). A service that keeps files
 * keeps them somewhere of its own and hands out a URL; services/documents does exactly that.
